##  Key Features

* **End-to-End Learning:** Classifies user intent directly from raw audio waveforms, eliminating the need for an intermediate transcription step.
* **High Accuracy:** Achieves **98.84%** accuracy on the Fluent Speech Commands dataset.
* **State-of-the-Art Model:** Built on the powerful `Wav2Vec2.0` architecture for robust speech representation.
* **Real-Time Inference:** Capable of processing microphone input for live intent prediction.
* **Interactive Web UI:** Deployed with a user-friendly Gradio interface on Hugging Face Spaces.
* **31 Command Intents:** Trained to recognize 31 unique intents for smart home and device control.

##  Methodology & Architecture

The project follows a modular deep learning pipeline, from data preparation to real-time inference. The core of the system is a `Wav2Vec2.0` model fine-tuned for the specific task of intent classification.

1.  **Data Preparation:** Audio from the Fluent Speech Commands dataset is loaded, resampled to 16kHz, and augmented.
2.  **Model Architecture:** A pre-trained `Wav2Vec2.0` model is used as the backbone. A custom classification head with Layer Normalization, an Attention mechanism, and a final Linear layer is added for intent prediction.
3.  **Training Strategy:** The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer, a dynamic learning rate scheduler, and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
4.  **Evaluation:** Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a held-out test set.
5.  **Real-Time Inference:** The trained model is deployed to predict intent from live microphone input.

##  Performance & Results

The model demonstrates excellent and consistent performance across all 31 intent classes.

### Training & Validation Accuracy
The model converges quickly and generalizes well, with both training and validation accuracy reaching ~98% without signs of overfitting.

### Accuracy Per Class
High accuracy is maintained across all individual classes, showcasing the model's robustness.

### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix shows a strong diagonal, indicating very few misclassifications between intents. Most minor confusions occur between acoustically similar commands.

### F1 Score per Class
-1 score is one of the common measures to rate how successful a classifier is. Itâ€™s the harmonic mean of two other metrics, namely: precision and recall. In a binary classification problem, the formula is:

  \[\textrm{F-1 Score} = \frac{2 \times \textrm{Precision} \times \textrm{Recall}}{\textrm{Precision} + \textrm{Recall}}\]

##  Dataset

This project uses the **Fluent Speech Commands (FSC)** dataset, which contains over 30,000 English utterances designed for spoken language understanding. Each command is annotated with an `action`, `object`, and `location`. For this project, these combinations were mapped to 31 unique intent classes.

##  Future Work

-   Expand the model to cover a broader range of intents and languages.
-   Improve robustness in noisy environments and with multiple speakers.
-   Optimize for lower latency using techniques like model quantization.
-   Integrate with real-world APIs to execute the recognized commands (e.g., smart home APIs).
